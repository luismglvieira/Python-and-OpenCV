# openCvTutorials
Applying my Computer Vision knowledge to OpenCV libraries.

This will act as a complement to my knowledge on Computer Vision for Matlab, which was aquired in my master's degree in Mechanical Engineering. You can find my Matlab projects over here.

The reasoning behind this decision is that Matlab requires an expensive license, so the companies don't use it and usually overlook my skill. This is why I opt to learn an open source library, and it's very exciting that it has a growing community.

First set of tutorials are taken from the book "Learning OpenCV: Computer Vision with the OpenCV Library" by Gary Bradski & Adrian Kaebler.
