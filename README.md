# openCvTutorials
Applying my Computer Vision knowledge to OpenCV libraries.

First set of tutorials are taken from the book "Learning OpenCV: Computer Vision with the OpenCV Library" by Gary Bradski & Adrian Kaebler.

This will act as a complement on my knowledge on Computer Vision for Matlab aquired on my University. You can find my Matlab projects over here.
