# openCvTutorials
Applying my Computer Vision knowledge to OpenCV libraries.

First set of tutorials are taken from the book "Learning OpenCV: Computer Vision with the OpenCV Library" by Gary Bradski & Adrian Kaebler.

This will act as a complement to my knowledge on Computer Vision for Matlab, which was aquired in my master's degree in Mechanical Engineering. You can find my Matlab projects over here.
