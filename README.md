# openCvTutorials
Applying my Computer Vision knowledge to OpenCV libraries.

This will act as a complement to my knowledge on Computer Vision for Matlab, which was aquired in my master's degree in Mechanical Engineering. You can find my Matlab projects on folder "00 - A Matlab prelude on Computer Vision". I call it a prelude because it's a prelude to my OpenCV learning, but I have some complex bits of code in there and some fun algorithms. It was very demmanding as a starting point because I don't have a programming academic background.

The reasoning behind my decision to learn OpenCV is that Matlab requires a rather expensive license, so the companies don't use it and they usually overlook my skills. This is why I opted to start learning an open source library, and it's very exciting that it has a growing community. At the same time, I always wanted to learn Python because it's open source, and it's perfect to use on Linux and Arduino, two platforms that I use on a daily basis. So it all comes together for me to start mastering OpenCV.

**01 - OpenCV Python Tutorial For Beginners**

I'll start by watching a free course for the IDE PyCharm available on youtube. You can find the link to this playlist down below. My files associated with this course can be found in the folder "01 - OpenCV Python Tutorial For Beginners". [Link for the youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS1QulWo1RIa7D1O6skqDQ-JZ1GGHKK-K)

To run the .py files and test these codes yourself, you need to download the samples folder on https://github.com/opencv/opencv and paste it in this project folder. You can see on my .py files that I usually call out files from these directories, like images, because I didn't want to duplicate these files and move them around. I wanted to read them directly from their original source. Maybe later I adapt the code and add all files to the root folder.

Also, if you're using PyCharm you need to add the package opencv-python to your Settings/Project-Interpreter. Also make sure to have at least Python 3.8 loaded up. That's all to run these codes, it's a pretty easy configuration. At least for Linux this is all you need, if you're using Windows, check [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3AT9EGp4iw)

**02 - Learning OpenCV - Computer Vision with the OpenCV Library**

Second group of tutorials are taken from the book "Learning OpenCV: Computer Vision with the OpenCV Library" by Gary Bradski & Adrian Kaebler. The files can be found in the folder "02 - Learning OpenCV - Computer Vision with the OpenCV Library". I plan to go back and forth between this book and the youtube playlist.

**03 - Master Deep Learning Computer Vision**

When I finish these two, I'll start this course that I bought on Udemy. I'll place the files under the folder "03 - Master Deep Learning Computer Vision". It's supposed to have more advanced content and not so much for beginners. We'll see. [This is the one.](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-deep-learning-computer-visiontm-cnn-ssd-yolo-gans/)

Who knows what comes next. Hopefuly I'll be finally working on this area professionally.
